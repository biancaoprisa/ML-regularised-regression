In this project I have used regularised regression models in order to identify the variables which predict whether a company will go bankrupt within the medium term (4 years). 
For this purpose, I have constructed models using ridge and lasso logistic regression, as well as elastic nets and assess which model is best at predicting bankruptcy.
